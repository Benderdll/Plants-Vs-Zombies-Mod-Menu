## Download and Install

(sorry I can't upload the .exe, github only allows 25MB files..)

Download the solution of Visual Studio Code. Open it, and it should open Visual Studio 2022.
Click on Build -> Build Solution. Then, whatever you have the solution. The .exe with the "cimhui.dll" and "SDL2.dll" should be in:

\bin\Release\net6.0\win-x86\publish\

Hope you enjoy it.
